### 👋 About Me
I'm a Data Scientist with 2+ years of experience in building intelligent systems that combine classic machine learning with cutting-edge GenAI. I’ve worked on large-scale document parsing, knowledge graphs, and agentic RAG architectures using tools like Neo4j, LangChain, and AWS. I enjoy turning messy, unstructured data into clean, insightful systems that answer smart questions.

- 🔍 Currently working on: **Graph-Based Knowledge Retrieval Systems** for unstructured documents  
- 🧠 Interests: Generative AI, Knowledge Graphs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Neo4j, LangGraph, Multi-agent systems  
- ☁️ Cloud: AWS Certified | EKS | Lambda | S3  
- 🧰 Stack: Python · PyTorch · FastAPI · Streamlit · Spark · Docker
